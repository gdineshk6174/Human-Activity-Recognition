# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human activity recognition, or HAR is identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data.
Movements such as walking,walking_upstairs,walking_downstairs,standing,sitting and laying.

I have built multiple LSTM models with different layers , nodes and dropout rates and compared training/ test accuracy across all them.
